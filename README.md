CHANGES WE MADE TO THE HTML FILE
================================
- We commented out all inline CSS, and in the case of Pride and Prejudice actually deleted it.
- In the Second Treatise of Government we changed the toc3 tag to toc2 to reflect that we only have two types of Table of Contents in our 3 html files.
- Notably; like the original CSS we chose to handle H3 separately from H1-H6 due to it being handled uniquely in the HTML files.

OTHER CITATIONS
===============
- Good CSS - Bootstrap Sandstone Theme by Thomas Park    <https://bootswatch.com/sandstone/>
- Bad  CSS - Bootstrap Geo Theme by Divshot              <http://code.divshot.com/geo-bootstrap/>
- Navigation Bar - Based on W3 School Bootstrap Tutorial <http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_navbar.asp>

We also borrowed some CSS from the Sandstone Theme and used it in the Geo Theme as well as added our own minor additions.
