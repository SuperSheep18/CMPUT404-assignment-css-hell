CHANGES WE MADE TO THE HTML FILE
================================
- We commented out all inline CSS, and in the case of Pride and Prejudice actually deleted it.
- In the Second Treatise of Government we changed the toc3 tag to toc2 to reflect that we only have two types of Table of Contents in our 3 html files.
- Notably; like the original CSS we chose to handle H3 separately from H1-H6 due to it being handled uniquely in the HTML files.
